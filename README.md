7. API Endpoints / Architecture
üìä System Architecture
    Frontend (ReactJS)
        |
        ‚Üì
    Backend API (Node.js / Express)
        |
        ‚Üì
    Database (MySQL / MongoDB)
    Frontend: React app for users to book rooms.

    Backend: RESTful API built using Node.js/Express.

    ----------------- API Endpoints E.g ------------------------
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------    
    | Method   | Endpoint                  | Description                 |
    | -------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
    | `GET`    | `/api/rooms`              | Get list of all rooms       |
    | `POST`   | `/api/rooms/search`       | Search available rooms      |
    | `POST`   | `/api/bookings`           | Create a new room booking   |
    | `GET`    | `/api/bookings/:id`       | Get booking details by ID   |
    | `GET`    | `/api/bookings/user/:uid` | Get all bookings for a user |
    | `POST`   | `/api/auth/login`         | Login user/admin            |
    | `POST`   | `/api/auth/register`      | Register new user           |
    | `GET`    | `/api/admin/rooms`        | Admin: View all rooms       |
    | `POST`   | `/api/admin/rooms`        | Admin: Add a new room       |
    | `PUT`    | `/api/admin/rooms/:id`    | Admin: Update room details  |
    | `DELETE` | `/api/admin/rooms/:id`    | Admin: Delete room          |

Like we use these approach 
    Database: Stores rooms, users, and bookings (MySQL or MongoDB).
    üìä Database Tables
        user: stores users, roles
        room: stores conference room info
        time_slot: all 30-minute intervals, is_booked flag
        booking: stores booking date, confirmation code, room/user mapping
        booking_time_slot: join table between booking and time_slot

    üîÆ Future Improvements
        Admin dashboard UI
        Room filtering (by type, capacity)
        Weekly view calendar for bookings
        Recurring meeting support
        Email templates (HTML-based)
